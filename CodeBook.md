The CodeBook
The data has been taken from the file that is on the assignment page. The cleaning and other movements are done on the script. In the script I made a code to have all the information in one dataset, so its easier to take the information just from one place.
In the README file  you can find the letter from te assignment
The idea of the script is to find the mean of the different variables from the different activities and subjects.For example, "1_LAYING" is the mean of the subject 1 for LAYING.
the table contains different variables represented by columns, and each activity is represented by a row.
